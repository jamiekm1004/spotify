# Spotify Track Analysis

An analytical project exploring Spotify tracks and playlists using **Python** and **SQL** to uncover insights about track popularity, genre trends, and feature correlations. This project also demonstrates database management with MySQL and interactive visualizations created using Python libraries.

## Features

- **Database Management:**
  - Designed and populated a MySQL database with over 30,000 Spotify tracks and playlists.
  - Ran complex SQL queries to analyze track popularity and energy levels.

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Processed raw Spotify data in Python to handle duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.
  - Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features and scaling for numerical data.

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Conducted correlation and regression analyses to identify factors influencing track popularity.
  - Generated descriptive statistics for features such as energy, valence, and danceability.

- **Visualization:**
  - Created bar charts and scatter plots in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate key findings.

## Key Insights

- Tracks with higher **loudness** and **valence** tend to have slightly higher popularity.
- **Genre-Specific Trends:**
  - **Danceability** is highest in electronic genres.
  - **Energy levels** vary significantly between genres, with pop tracks showing medium energy.
- Correlation analysis reveals weak linear relationships between features and track popularity, suggesting nonlinear influences.
